I did an example using ReactJS and NodeJS.
I used some frameworks like:
* NodeJS to make a simple API to simulate any data.
* Socket.IO to REAL-TIME ENGINE".To see it working,  open another browser and go in "Frameworks" sector and click in "Approve/Decline".
* Redux to a predictable state container. You can use Redux DevTools to see it working. 
* ChartJS for Charts.
* React-Semantic-UI to create beautiful and responsive layouts.

# Install API Server

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
    
# Install React Application

* Install and start the React Application
    - `cd front-end`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
